# Descriptions
In this folder, we generate samples in Directory **VBF_H5pp_ww_jjjj**, **VBF_H5mm_ww_jjjj**, and **VBF_H5z_ww_jjjj**. Then the jet samples are selected in **extract*.py** and the selected samples are divided into training, valid, and testing dataest in **convert*.py*. For the last two step, they are executed in **run.sh**. The datasets are saved in folder **samples_kappa* ** (They are not archived in GitHub since they are too big.), and ready to be used for machine learning.
